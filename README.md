# Porfolio Project
*My first repository on Github*

I made this porfolio project to practice HTML, CSS and later Javascript.

I was inspired to make it while I was following the 50Projects50Days on Udemy by Brad Traversy and Florin Pops. I had the idea to make a Porftolio to showcase projects no matter how small or unnecessary they may be and although this Porfolio Project won't be actaully be published on the internet, still it is a great way to play with HTML, CSS and Javscript. 

Suggestions and helpful opinions would be highly appreciated! 

*P.S. I know my CSS file here is a chaos. I might have to redo it later.*
